# Mini-Projects
<h2>Project Description</h2>These small projects were developed using HTML and CSS to demonstrate my front-end development skills. Created during my early learning phase, they helped me build a strong foundation in web design and deepen my understanding of these core technologies. Through these projects, I gained hands-on experience in structuring web pages, implementing responsive layouts, and mastering the fundamentals of web development.
